funny scripts and programs that i use at the 42 school (≧∇≦)

## How to install

install script coming soon...

### Manually

modify the ``VIDEO_FILE`` var in the ``ft_cock`` script in the ``bin`` file to the folder containing the video you want on your lock screen.

add the ``bin`` file to your path.

add the ``lib`` file to your LD_LIBRARY_PATH env var.

that's it ! change your config to launch ``ft_cock`` instead of ``ft_lock`` and enjoy the funny video (˶ᵔᵕᵔ˶)
